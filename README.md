# 02-Space-Shooter
Exercise for MSCH-C220, 25 February 2021

A project where you make an arcade space shooter game

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.3
Includes WASD mappings (up, left, down, right) and escape to quit
as well as shooting with right and left mouse buttons.

## References
I made all of the art for this using Piskelapp.com

## Future Development
I think that I am going to work a bit more on this. 
I want to make the bullets not follow the mouse, but still 
move from wherever the ship is pointing.
